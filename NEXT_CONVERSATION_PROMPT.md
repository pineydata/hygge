# hygge Next Conversation Prompt

## Current Status: Project-Centric CLI Implementation foundations ✅

We've successfully implemented a project-centric CLI that transforms hygge from a library into a framework:

- **Comfort**: `hygge init` creates projects with sensible defaults and clear guidance
- **Simplicity**: `hygge start` starts flows with automatic project discovery
- **Reliability**: `hygge debug` provides clear error messages and configuration validation
- **Flow**: Project structure matches how people actually work with data tools

The CLI implementation shows hygge's true value: **making data movement feel natural and comfortable** while providing enterprise-grade project management.

## Next Development Phase: POC Verification - End-to-End Testing 🧪

With CLI implementation complete, we can now focus on proving hygge works with real data movement scenarios. This is the critical step that transforms hygge from a framework prototype into a production-ready tool.

### POC Verification: Proving hygge Works with Real Data 🎯
**Focus**: Validating hygge handles actual data movement scenarios reliably

**Benefits**:
- **Confidence**: Verify the parquet-to-parquet example works end-to-end
- **Comfort**: Know that hygge can handle real data without surprises
- **Reliability**: Test with actual parquet files and realistic data volumes
- **Flow**: Ensure data movement is smooth and efficient in practice

**Why This Serves hygge's Mission**:
- **Comfort**: Developers can trust hygge works with real data
- **Reliability**: Proves the framework handles actual workloads
- **Flow**: Validates that data movement feels natural in practice

### POC Verification Success Metrics 🎯

**Comfort Through Confidence**:
- **"hygge works with real data"** - proven, tested behavior
- **"I can trust hygge"** - validated with actual workloads
- **"Data movement feels reliable"** - tested with realistic scenarios

### What POC Verification Involves 📋

1. **End-to-End Testing**: Run complete parquet-to-parquet workflows using CLI
2. **Real Data Validation**: Test with actual parquet files and realistic schemas
3. **Performance Testing**: Validate efficiency with larger datasets
4. **Error Scenario Testing**: Verify graceful handling of real-world issues
5. **Integration Verification**: Ensure all components work together seamlessly
6. **User Experience Validation**: Confirm CLI commands work smoothly in practice

## Current Achievement: Project-Centric CLI Complete ✅

**Phase 2 Complete**: We've successfully implemented **Project-Centric CLI** because:

1. **Foundation of Comfort**: Project structure makes hygge feel like a professional tool ✅
2. **Trust Enables Flow**: CLI commands work predictably and guide users naturally ✅
3. **Prevents Discomfort**: Clear error messages and project discovery prevent confusion ✅
4. **Enables Growth**: Project structure scales with data complexity ✅

### What We Built
- **Project Discovery**: Automatic `hygge.yml` detection with dbt-style error messages
- **Flow Directory Structure**: Organized `flows/` with `entities/` subdirectories
- **Entity Defaults Inheritance**: Flow-level defaults applied to individual entities
- **CLI Commands**: `hygge init`, `hygge start`, `hygge debug` with comprehensive testing
- **Clean Project Structure**: No runtime artifacts, data stays external

## hygge's True Success Metrics 🎯

### Comfort Metrics
- **"It just works"**: Zero configuration surprises
- **"Feels natural"**: APIs that make sense intuitively
- **"No friction"**: Smooth data movement without hiccups

### Reliability Metrics
- **"Predictable behavior"**: Consistent results every time
- **"Graceful failures"**: Errors that don't break the experience
- **"Easy recovery"**: Simple ways to fix issues

### Flow Metrics
- **"Smooth movement"**: Data flows naturally between systems
- **"Visible progress"**: Clear understanding of what's happening
- **"Efficient processing"**: Fast, optimized data movement

## Ready for POC Verification: Making hygge Production-Ready 🏠

The CLI implementation shows hygge working as intended - **comfortable, reliable project management**. Combined with the registry pattern and parquet-to-parquet example, we now have a complete framework foundation.

**Next Goal**: Prove hygge works reliably with real data movement scenarios.

### Immediate Next Steps 🚀

1. **Create Realistic Test Data**: Generate larger parquet files with real-world schemas
2. **Run End-to-End Workflows**: Use `hygge init`, `hygge start` with actual data
3. **Test Error Scenarios**: Verify graceful handling of missing files, permissions, etc.
4. **Validate Performance**: Test with larger datasets to ensure efficiency
5. **Document Findings**: Record any issues or improvements needed

This approach follows hygge's philosophy: **comfort through confidence**. Once we prove hygge works reliably with real data, adding new data sources will feel natural and safe.
