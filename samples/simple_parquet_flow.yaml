# Simple parquet-to-parquet flow
# Copy this file and update the paths for your data

flows:
  simple_flow:
    home: data/source.parquet
    store: data/destination
    # That's it! Everything else uses smart defaults:
    # - batch_size: 10000 (home), 100000 (store)
    # - compression: snappy
    # - file_pattern: simple_flow_{sequence:020d}.parquet
    # - queue_size: 10
