# LLM Context for hygge

## Start Here
**Read [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** - Complete project guide with all essential information

## Critical Constraint
- **Always ask permission before running terminal commands** - Request explicit approval before executing any commands

## Development Style
- Be direct and candid (not deferential)
- Focus on hygge's ethos: comfort, reliability, natural data movement
- Prioritize user experience over technical perfection
- **Follow Rails philosophy**: programmer happiness, beautiful code, smart defaults
- **Think like a data engineer**: outcomes and impact matter more than perfection

## Key Principles
- **Test immediately** after implementing functionality
- **Rails-inspired**: convention over configuration, programmer happiness, beautiful code
- **Comfort over complexity** - make data movement feel natural
- **Make progress, not perfection** - ship working solutions

## Reference Materials
- **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** - Complete project guide (start here)
- **[../README.md](../README.md)** - Project documentation
- **[../HYGGE_PROGRESS.md](../.progress/HYGGE_PROGRESS.md)** - Detailed progress assessment

## Quick Start
1. Read [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for complete project understanding
2. Follow the hygge philosophy: simple, comfortable, reliable
3. **Write tests immediately** after implementing features

# Before Starting Work

## Context Verification
- [ ] Have you read [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)?
- [ ] Do you understand hygge's philosophy and constraints?
- [ ] Are you familiar with the Rails philosophy (all 9 principles)?
- [ ] Are you aware that terminal commands require permission?
- [ ] Will you write tests immediately after implementing functionality?
- [ ] Do you think like a data engineer: outcomes over perfection?

**If any answer is "no", ask the user to re-provide context before proceeding.**
